his project demonstrates how to build a multi-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, Groq, and ChromaDB. The pipeline integrates data from two different sources: a live web page and a local Excel file.

Features
Web Scraping: Loads and processes content from a specified URL using WebBaseLoader.
Excel Data Integration: Reads and processes data from an Excel file (.xlsx) using pandas and converts it into a format suitable for the RAG pipeline.
Multi-Source Retriever: Uses EnsembleRetriever to combine data from both the web and Excel sources into a unified retrieval system.
Vector Database: Employs ChromaDB to store vector embeddings of the processed text chunks from both sources.
Language Model Integration: Leverages the ChatGroq language model for generating responses based on the retrieved context.
Complete RAG Chain: Constructs a full RetrievalQA chain that can answer queries by retrieving relevant information from either or both data sources.
How It Works
Installation: The notebook begins by installing all necessary libraries, including langchain, langchain-groq, chromadb, and others.
Data Loading: It loads content from a specified web page and an Excel file.
Text Processing: The loaded documents are split into smaller, manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
Embedding and Storage: The text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings and stored in two separate ChromaDB vector databases (one for web data, one for Excel data).
Multi-Source Retrieval: An EnsembleRetriever is configured to query both vector databases simultaneously.
RAG Chain Creation: A RetrievalQA chain is set up with the multi-source retriever and the ChatGroq language model.
Querying: The notebook demonstrates how to invoke the RAG chain with queries that can be answered using information from the web page, the Excel file, or a combination of both.
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have a Groq API key and have added it to your environment or Colab secrets.
Upload the AP_Reorganization_Site_Prices.xlsx file to the same directory as the notebook (or update the file path in the notebook).
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to set up the pipeline and perform queries.
